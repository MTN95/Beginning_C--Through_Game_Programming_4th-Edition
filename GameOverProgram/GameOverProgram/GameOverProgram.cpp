// Defining The Main Function
/*
A function is a group of programming code that can do some work and return
a value. In this case, int indicates that the function will return an integer
value. All function headers have a pair of parentheses after the function name.

NOTE: 
All C++ programs must have a function called main(), which is the starting
point of the program. The real action begins here.

The next line marks the beginning of the function.
{
And the very last line of the program marks the end of the function.
}

All functions are delimited by a pair of curly braces, and everything between
them is part of the function. Code between two curly braces is called a block
and is usually indented to show that it forms a unit. The block of code that
makes up an entire function is called the body of the function.
